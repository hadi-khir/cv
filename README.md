## My CV

This was a fun little project for me to digitalize my CV. Ended up going with NextJS, and tailwinds, even though that is a bit overkill. If you like what you see, I've included some of the design info below, like the colorscheme and typefaces. You can fork the repository, and run it with the commands below. I will keep a list of dependencies (if any) in here. 

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn install
yarn dev
# or
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
